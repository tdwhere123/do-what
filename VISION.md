# OpenWork Vision

**Mission:** Make your company feel 1000× more productive.

**How:** We give AI agents the tools your team already uses and let them learn from your behavior. The more you use OpenWork, the more connected your tools become, the more knowledge accumulates, and the bigger the chunks of work you can automate.

**Today:** OpenWork is the simplest interface to `opencode` and OpenWork server surfaces. Double-click, pick a folder, and you get three things instantly:

1. **Zero-friction setup** — your existing opencode configuration just works, no migration needed
2. **Chat access** — WhatsApp and Telegram ready to go (one token, done)
3. **Cloud-ready** — every app doubles as a client; connect to hosted workers from anywhere

Current cloud mental model:

- OpenWork app is the experience layer.
- OpenWork server is the control/API layer.
- OpenWork worker is the runtime destination.
- Connect flow is intentionally simple: `Add a worker` -> `Connect remote`.

OpenWork helps users ship agentic workflows to their team. It works on top of opencode (opencode.ai) an agentic coding platform that exposes apis and sdks. We care about maximally using the opencode primitives. And build the thinest possible layer - always favoring opencode apis over custom built ones.

In other words:
- OpenCode is the **engine**.
- OpenWork is the **experience** : onboarding, safety, permissions, progress, artifacts, and a premium-feeling UI.

OpenWork competes directly with Anthropic's Cowork conceptually, but stays open, local-first, and standards-based.

## Non-Goals

- Replacing OpenCode's CLI/TUI.
- Creating bespoke "magic" capabilities that don't map to OpenCode APIs.
